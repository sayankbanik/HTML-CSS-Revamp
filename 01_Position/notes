position: relative;

- elements fits in the normal flow but
- top, right, bottom and left and z-index can be used to move the element from its default position or spot
- **even if the document is offset but its original space in the document is maintained**
- means, initial position of the element will not taken by any other element, it still belongs to that particular element only
- top: 50px; it will move 50px from top so comes to bottom

z-index

- when there are multiple overlapping elements, higher z-index valued element will be visually on top.
- default value; 
  z-index: 0;
- **only applied when the elements positioned other than default(static)**

position: absolute;

- Element is removed from the normal document flow and is now relative to its nearest parent element with an explicit position property
- if no parent element has position property other than default (static), it is relative to the root
- no space is left where it used to be, means that it will not have any space for it, so it can be overlapped on other element depends on the parent
- when the parent has no position property, child element does not consider itself in the parent element only take root element as it's parent 
  and behave like that (for example see the Hello there part in code)


position: fixed;

- Element is removed from the normal document flow(like absolute)
- Element is positioned relative to root container element
- No space is left for that element where it used to be
- when scroll the page, it will stay in place
- top,right,left,bottom and z-index can be used to scoot the element relative to the root element
